# Description
This HTML and CSS code constructs a straightforward, cross-browser compatible developer portfolio website, designed to showcase William's skills and projects. Created within the Visual Studio Code environment, the code leverages standard web technologies to ensure broad accessibility. The HTML structure is semantically sound, employing elements like <nav>, <header>, <section>, and <footer> to clearly define different page sections. The navigation bar, fixed at the top, provides easy access to the "About," "Projects," and "Contact" sections, enhancing user experience. The main content area begins with a header introducing William as a "Full Stack Developer | AI Enthusiast," setting the stage for the content that follows.

The "About Me" section provides a concise narrative of William's professional background and interests, highlighting his experience with modern technologies like JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, and Python. It emphasizes his passion for problem-solving and building scalable applications, conveying his dedication to the field. The "Projects" section then offers a glimpse into William's practical skills, showcasing three distinct projects: a Netflix-like streaming application with AI-powered recommendations, an AI chatbot for instant assistance, and a JavaScript-based game. Each project is presented within a white box, providing a clean and organized layout, and is accompanied by a concise description. The "Contact" section, similarly styled, provides William's email address, enabling potential collaborators or employers to easily reach out. A simple footer with a copyright notice completes the page.

The CSS styling complements the HTML structure by creating a clean and minimalist design, ensuring consistent rendering across various browsers. The use of a light gray background and a sans-serif font contributes to a professional and readable aesthetic. The navigation bar is styled with a white background and a subtle box shadow, ensuring it stands out while remaining unobtrusive. The use of flexbox in the main-content div ensures that the footer is consistently positioned at the bottom of the viewport, regardless of the content's length. Each section is styled with appropriate padding, creating visual separation and improving readability. The project boxes and the contact section are designed with rounded corners and box shadows, adding a touch of visual appeal and providing a sense of depth. Hover effects on these elements provide interactive feedback, enhancing the user experience.

This portfolio website, developed using Visual Studio Code, is designed to be straightforward and easily navigable, focusing on presenting William's skills and projects in a clear and concise manner. The combination of semantic HTML and clean, cross-browser compatible CSS styling results in a user-friendly and visually appealing website that effectively serves its purpose as a developer's online resume. The emphasis on simplicity and clarity makes it easy for visitors to quickly grasp William's capabilities and experience, making it a valuable tool for networking and career advancement. The use of common, well-supported CSS properties ensures that the site renders consistently across modern browsers, providing a reliable experience for all visitors.
